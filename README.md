# Real-Estate-Trends
Project from my data visualization class at CUNY Baruch College. The project analyzes the U.S. real estate trends from the last decade. You will see how my team cleaned the dataset and visualized the information.
We started by importing all necessary libraries, then load the national and state datasets. We review the datasets by assessing its shape and checking the datatype for each column. Next we removed all unnecessary columns and edit the information. We check and fix all null values, then save the cleaned datasets. Our team extracted the data for New  York from the State dataset.
Our team began visualizing the national data with a bar chart showing price drops throughout the country from 2012 to 2023. Our second bar graph for the national dataset displays the number of homes sold per year nationaly, again from 2012 to 2023, the most number of homes sold was 700,000 in 2021.
Next we visualized the state dataset with a bar chart that presents the median sale price by state with Hawaii having the highest price. We then converted that bar chart to a pice graph to display the top ten median sale prices per state in the country. Lastly, we created a histogram of the median sale price distribution in New York.
